# Students Presence Tracker

Simple API that tracks students' presence in particular classes by performing some calculations and adding them to a database.

### Database types used in this project: `CSV`, `JSON`, `SQLite`
### Files in `main` module work with specific type of database 

- `context-manager.py` deals with database's connection, committing and closing the database automatically. 
- files in `utils` module deal with the database, calculations, adding new students, listing the students, deleting the students.
- files in `main` module deal with the user inputs, displaying options, and working with the required functions.
